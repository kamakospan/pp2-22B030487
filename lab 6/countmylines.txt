It’s a special day at the ABC Zoo. A new animal is here.
‘What’s in it?’
‘It’s a zorilla from Africa. She needs a home.’
‘Mmm, zorilla, eh? OK, let’s find you a home.’
‘Let’s see. An aardvark, a boa constrictor, a coyote and a duck-billed platypus. The
zorilla doesn’t go here.’
‘Let’s see. An emu, a flamingo, a giraffe and a hyena. The zorilla doesn’t go here.’
‘Let’s see. A xenops, a yak, a zorilla! Here’s your home!’
‘Sorry, boys!’
